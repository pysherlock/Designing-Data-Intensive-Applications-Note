# Part 1. Foundations of Data Systems

## Let's think about how to design a data system :)

## Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

Many applications of this kind need to:
  Store data => databases
  Remeber the result of an expensive operation => caches
  Allow users to search data by keyword or filter => search indexes
  Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously => ***stream processing***
  Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data => *** batch processing ***
 
One possible architecture for a data system that combines several components.
